## **Employee Well-being and Survey Analytics**

### **Project Overview**
This project explores the impact of workplace policies on employee well-being and productivity using a combination of **survey analytics** and **causal inference methods**. The analysis is divided into two key components:

### **1. Survey Analytics**
- Utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, including **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**, to categorize employee feedback from workplace surveys.
- Identifies key themes such as **work-life balance, workplace comfort, health & wellness, collaboration, and professional growth**.
- Provides **data visualizations** to highlight sentiment trends and employee priorities.

### **2. Well-being Program Causal Analysis**
- Implements **causal inference techniques** (e.g., **causalml**) to assess the effectiveness of workplace policies.
- Evaluates the impact of well-being initiatives on **productivity, absenteeism, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency**.
- Uses **machine learning models**, including **logistic regression**, to estimate causal effects.
- Measures policy impact after a **quarterly period**, allowing for insights into long-term effectiveness.
- Incorporates **synthetic data generation** to simulate workplace conditions and test different intervention scenarios.

### **Key Insights & Applications**
This project provides **data-driven recommendations** for optimizing workplace policies. By analyzing real employee feedback and assessing causal relationships, it enables organizations to **make informed decisions** that enhance employee well-being, reduce absenteeism, and improve overall performance.
